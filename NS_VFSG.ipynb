    "\n",
    "The project currently includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Demographic Bar Charts**: Display participant distribution by age, gender, and referring organisation industry.\n",
    "- **Demographic Pie Charts**: Provide a visual breakdown of participant demographics.\n",
    "- **Impact Scatter Plot Chart**: Show changes in well-being scores impact, highlighting the effectiveness of Noise Solution‚Äôs programmes.\n",

    "\n",
    "- [NS_Data.xls](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coriander31415/NoiseSolution-VizForSocialGood/main/data/NS_Data.xls): Contains anonymised participant data, including demographics and well-being scores.\n",
    "- [postcode_to_region_mapping.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coriander31415/NoiseSolution-VizForSocialGood/main/data/postcode_to_region_mapping.csv): Used to map participant postcodes to regions. *Note: This dataset will be used in future versions of the dashboard.*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Interactive Visualisation**: Built using Bokeh, the dashboard allows users to explore data with tooltips and dynamic layouts.\n",
    "- **Custom Colour Palette**: A clear and accessible colour scheme ensures that the visualisations are easy to understand.\n",
    "- **Future Plans**: Upcoming features include geo-mapping to show participant distribution across regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Bokeh?\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose **Bokeh** for this project due to its interactive features, which align well with my previous experience in **Tableau**, my favourite visualisation tool. This project allowed me to practice building interactive, custom dashboards using Python3, and Bokeh provided a great way to bring that to life.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running the Project\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Ensure you have the required libraries installed:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    pip3 install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Open the project in VS Code and run the Python file:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    python3 NS_VFSG.py\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    \n",
    "This will generate the HTML dashboard, which you can then open in your browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Contributing\n",
    "\n",
    "As this is a learning project, I welcome contributions, especially those focused on improving the visualisations or adding new features. Please feel free to create an issue or submit a pull request."
